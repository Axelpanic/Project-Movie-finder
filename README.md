# <Project-Movie-Finder>

## Description ðŸŽžðŸ”Ž

Movie Finder allows the user input the titles of movies and return the results from a movie database. The information returned allows the user to view a snapshot of details including, but not limited to: Title, Year, Cast, Genre....

As a collective we chose this particular idea for our project based on our mutual appreciation for movies. Given the acceptance criteria, we felt the overall idea meshed well with APIs we included in our webpages functionality. 

Our group utlized the Web API's IMDB and Wiki. IMDB offered our webpage the movie specific details the user would inquire about. Wiki allowed our webpage to offer and brief description in addition to the movie findings. Previous search results will be commit to Local Storage.

To give our page a unique appearance we found that Bulma was not only easy to use for creating the framework, but allowed our group to focus on more complex obstacles like creating a Modal, ensure our APIs were generating the results on our page as we had imagined, debugging our code when inspection was tested and committing search results to local storage.
